        <h1>Welcome to golf</h1>
        <p>See below for an explanation on how this Pool is run.</p>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>
            The way this pool is run is fairly simple. Each golf tournament runs from Thursday until Sunday,
            with the champion golfer being declared at the end of Sunday's round. The tournament begins
            promptly on Thursday morning. Prior to the Thursday start of the current golf tournament, each
            user will have the opportunity to build a Team of 10 golfers from the list of all golfers competing
            in the tournament. You can find the list of golfers competing in the current tournament on the
            "Team Selection" page, which is sorted by the golfer's odds to win (best odds at the top,
            worst odds at the bottom). Points are awarded to golfers who finish the tournament in the top 10
            positions of the leaderboard at the end of Sunday. Your goal is to select the best 10-man roster,
            which you believe will award you the most combined points at the end of the tournament. So ideally,
            you want to select the 10 golfers whom you believe will finish in the top 10. Once you select your
            10-man roster, there is nothing more for you to do but sit back, enjoy some competitive golf and
            let the chips fall where they may.

            *Note* - Multiple users may select the same golfer(s). There is no draft. There is no limit on
                     how many different teams can have the same individual golfer on their roster. For instance,
                     every single user can have Rory McIlroy on their Team. The key to winning is balanced
                     risk-taking; choosing the golfer(s) who don't have great odds of winning, but end up
                     finishing in the top 10 at the end of the tournament. These golfers will award you many
                     points.

            You may edit your 10-man roster at any time prior to the start of the tournament, but it is on you
            to ensure that your roster is complete with 10 golfers - no more, no less. Once the first golfer of
            the day tees off on Thursday, the tournament has begun and the selection page will be locked for
            the entirety of the tournament, deeming the pool closed. You will not be able to go back and change
            your 10-man roster. The Team you build is your Team for the entirety of the 4-day tournament.

        <h3>How Points are Awarded</h3>
        <p>
            Points are not accumulated over rounds. If one of your golfers finished in the top 10 in each of
            the first three rounds, then come Sunday, he finishes the tournament in 12th place, you are
            awarded 0 points for that golfer.
        </p>

        <h3>Team Builder</h3>
        <p>
            In order to select your 10-man roster, you will navigate to the "Team Builder" page. A link to
            this page is available in the navigation bar at the top of the site. Here, you will find a list
            of all golfers competing in the current tournament. To select a golfer, simply click the check-box
            next to his name. Once you are satisfied with your 10 selections, click the submit button at the
            top of the "Team Builder" page and your roster will be saved.

            You can view your Team's roster at any time by navigating to the "My Team" page. A link to this
            page is available in the navigation bar, as well, at the top of the site.
        </p>

        <h3>Leaderboard</h3>
        <p>
            The Leaderboard page is where you will find the current standings of the Pool.

            After each round (day), Team points will be recalculated and the Leaderboard will be updated to
            reflect the current standings of the Pool. The Team standings do not matter until the end of Sunday,
            however, we believe it is best to show you where you currently stand on a rolling basis throughout
            the tournament.
        </p>

        <h3>Viewing Another Team's Roster</h3>
        <p>
            If you would like to view another Team's roster, simply navigate to the Leaderboard page (link in
            the navigation bar). Here, you will find a list of all Teams in the pool, sorted by their current
            standing. Hovering over a Team Name will reveal a link to that Team's profile page. Profile pages
            are where you can find information about each Team, including the Team's Owner and Roster.
